TO DO LIST
* Modify the gcn "framework"
    - want a train and test method
    - ensure it is compatible with the CV function I have done. I can surely wrap it in a customized estimator class (see old project)
* check all validation
* See what can be done with the feature importance plotting like in sex classification or comp bio paper
* Plots ?
