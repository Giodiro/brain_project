* check the thing with balanced random forest
* find the best training step (plots seems to indicate that 1000 steps is really overfitting) try to add more dropout or weight decay to see the impact

Later
* See what can be done with the feature importance plotting like in sex classification or comp bio paper
* Plots ?
