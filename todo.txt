TO DO LIST
* RERUN ALL THE EXP WITH THE UPSAMPLING WITH THE CORRECTED VERSION !!!!!!
* Create exp folder, more generally organize the code folder in subfolder cause it is becoming a mess. And do extended code checking and tidying. Put the unsused file in deprecated folder
* Create the experiment launcher to run all level of CV (with CV functions created in CV utils) with the classic classifiers.
* Modify the gcn "framework"
    - want a train and test method
    - ensure it is compatible with the CV function I have done. I can surely wrap it in a customized estimator class (see old project)
* Results should be saved somewhere like logs of whatever
* See what can be done with the feature importance plotting like in sex classification or comp bio paper
* Plots ?
